    <h3>What are promises and why do we need them?</h3>
    <pre>
        Promises are a way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. A promise is an object that represents the state of an operation that may not be completed yet, but will be in the future. Promises allow us to write cleaner and more manageable code than using callbacks or events.

        We need promises because they make it easier to deal with multiple asynchronous operations, avoid callback hell, and handle errors gracefully23. Promises also enable us to use async/await syntax, which makes the code look more synchronous and readable.
        
        Some examples of asynchronous operations that can use promises are:
        
        Fetching data from a server using the fetch() API.
        Reading or writing files using the FileReader or FileWriter API.
        Performing computations in a web worker using the postMessage() and onmessage API.

    <h3>What is promise chaining</h3>
    <p>Promise chaining is a technique in JavaScript that allows you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together using promises. The key idea is that a Promise’s then() function returns another promise, so you can chain then() calls together to tell JavaScript to execute async calls in order.</p>
    <hr><h3>What is the DOM?</h3>
    <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.</p>
    <hr><h3>What are closures? Give an example of closure</h3>
    <p>A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment (scope) within which that function was declared. Closures are a fundamental and powerful property of JavaScript.</p><hr>
    <h3>How many operators do we have in JS ?</h3>
    <ul><li><b>Arithmetic Operators:</b> perform arithmetic on numbers (e.g., +, -, *, /).</li>
    <li><b>Assignment Operators:</b> assign values to variables (e.g., =, +=, -=, *=).</li>
    <li><b>Comparison Operators:</b> compare two values and return a boolean value (e.g., ==, ===, !=, !==).</li>
    <li><b>Logical Operators:</b> used to determine the logic between variables or values (e.g., &&, ||, !).</li>
    <li><b>String Operators:</b> used to concatenate strings (e.g., +).</li>
    <li><b>Conditional (Ternary) Operator:</b> assigns a value to a variable based on a condition (e.g., ? :).</li>
    <li><b>Type Operators:</b> used to determine the data type of a variable (e.g., typeof, instanceof).</li></ul>><hr>
    <h3>What are objects in javascript?</h3>
    <pre>
        In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity with properties and type. Objects can be thought of as a collection of related data in the form of key-value pairs. Here’s an example:

        const car = {
          make: 'Honda',
          model: 'Civic',
          year: 2020
        };
        Copy
        In this example, car is an object with three properties: make, model, and year. Each property has a value associated with it ('Honda', 'Civic', and 2020, respectively).
